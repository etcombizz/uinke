        <p><strong>Mawphlang</strong></p>
        <p><span class="img-right"><img src="../images/mawphlang.jpg" alt="Mawphlang Sacred Grove"></span></p>
        
            <p>Location: East Khasi Hills District</p>
            <p>  One of the most remarkable features of the Khasi Hills are the sacred   forests, which have been preserved by traditional religious sanction, since the   ancient days. One of the most famous sacred forests is the Mawphlang Sacred   Forest, about 25 kilometres from Shillong. The sacred grove has an amazing life   form of plants, flowering trees, orchids and butterflies. An ideal destination   for nature lovers.</p>
            <p>The sacred-groves which have been preserved since time immemorial, are in   sharp contrast to their surrounding grasslands. These groves are generally   rimmed by a dense growth of Castanopsis kurzii trees, forming a protective hedge   which halts intrusion of Pinus kasia (Khasi pine) which dominates all areas   outside the sacred groves. Inside the outer rim, the sacred groves are virtually   Nature's Own Museum. The heavily covered grounds have a thick cushion of humus   accumulated over the centuries. The trees in every sacred groveare heavily   loaded with epiphytic growth of aroids, pipers, ferns, fern-allies and orchids.   The humus-covered grounds likewise harbour myriad varieties of plant life, many   of which are found nowhere else.</p>
            <p><span class="img-right"><img src="../images/nongkhnum.jpg" alt="Nongkhnum Beach"></span></p>
            <p><strong>Nongkhnum Island</strong></p>
                 <p>Location: West Khasi Hills District</p>
         <p>Nongkhnum Island is the <strong>biggest river island in Meghalaya and   the second biggest river island in Asia</strong>, after Majuli Island in Assam. Located about   14 Kms from Nongstoin, the district hqs. of West Khasi Hills, it is 20 to 25 sq.   kms in area. Travelling on foot from Nongstoin through the villages of Lawse,   Mawduh and Mawthar, it takes about two and a half-hours to reach the Island.   There is a wooden bridge over the Weinia Fall to enter the Island.<br />
                   The Island   is formed by the bifurcation of Kynshi River into the Phanliang River and the   Namliang River. At the point of divergence, there is a beautiful sandy shore   about 100 sq. meters in area. The Phanliang River forms a beautiful lake   adjacent to the sandy beach. This lake is about 400 to 500 sq. meters. The River   then moves along and before reaching a deep gorge, forms a pretty fall about 60   meters high, called Shadthum Fall. At the bottom of the fall, there is a beautiful pool where a variety of   fishes can be found. It then continues its journey and finally reunites with the   Namliang River, near a place called Thongrin.</p>
             <p>The Namliang River first flows towards the north and then   changes its course towards the west. It then reaches a gorge and forms two   narrow falls. The first one is called Riatsohkhe fall and is near Mawthar   village. The second one is the wonderful and beautiful Weinia fall, which is   about 60 meters high. The River then flows further west till it reunites with   the Phanliang River on the western rocky shore and then flow towards the west. After a distance of about 10 kms   from the Island, it reaches the deepest gorge and forms the longest fall in the   region of about 335 to 340 meters high, called Langshiang fall. </p>
             <p>The area surrounded by the two Rivers, i.e. Phanliang and   Namliang forms the Nongkhnum Island. Within the Island, there are big trees and   areas of grassland and natural playground suitable for playing football and golf   and even for landing a helicopter. There are plenty of fishing pools, especially   near the sandy shore, called Wei-Phanliang. Angling is the only way to enjoy as   well as protect the fishes.</p>

It   is believed that here, the spirits of the dead dwell   temporarily   before embarking on the final journey. Balpakram is sacred to the Garos   as the abode of the dead spirits. As mentioned earlier, the Garos are   deeply spiritual and believe in myths as interesting and awe-some as the Greeks mythlogics. In support of their beliefs,   Balpakram has many mysterious and unnatural phenomena that cannot be   satisfactorily explained by modern science and logic.</p>
<p>Some of these mysterious sites are <strong>Boldak matchu karam, Chidimak, Matchru, Areng patal, Goncho Dare, Dikkini ring, Rongsaljong Agal, Rongsobok Rongkol</strong>.</p>
<p>Apart from the above mentioned sites there  are many    mysterious places which you can explore yourself. Indeed Balpakram is so   steeped in myths that even the Hindus  believe that it is a sacred   place. They believe that when Laxman was seriously  injured during the   war with  Ravana and a very rare life saving herb was required, Hanuman   found it here but not knowing which to take  also in his haste to   return, broke the top of the hills and carried it away. The missing   portion of that hill  became a deep awning canyon. Balpakram has been   declared a National Park some years ago.  This place is about 220 sq kms   in area and is 167 kms from Tura. This place  is not only of   mythological  importance but also the natural habitant of many rare and   exotic animals and  plant life. It is also believed to be the original    home of the rare citrus plant Me-mang Narang. Balpakram is exquisitely    beautiful when ground orchids are in bloom. The best time to see is from    November to March. There is the guest house at Hattisil at the   entrance to Balpakram run by the Forest Department.</p>
